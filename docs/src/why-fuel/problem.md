# The Problem

The blockchain landscape has advanced rapidly, but key issues still limit decentralized technology’s potential. Fuel is designed to address these fundamental challenges head-on. To understand its significance, we must first examine the core problems that blockchains face today.

## The Performance Bottleneck

Performance can be measured in various ways, such as speed to finality, total execution load capacity, transactions per second and cost-efficiency. However, traditional networks like Ethereum struggle to scale efficiently across these aspects.

One of the critical issues is load. Ethereum, for example, can only process a limited number of transactions per second (TPS), compute unit per gas unit, or more broadly total execution capacity in general, because of the computation overhead around execution. Much of this computation is focused on proving cryptographic evidence of transactions. For instance, the EVM has a significant cryptographic burden in verifying and updating the state tree after every transaction. This inefficiency is compounded by the fact that Ethereum’s execution layer isn’t optimized for the underlying hardware, leading to unnecessary computational overhead.

Furthermore, these computations are executed sequentially, limiting throughput even more. If you remove the state tree and focus solely on EVM computation, Ethereum could potentially achieve up to 10,000 TPS. However, the real bottleneck comes from the execution side and the cryptographic evidence required for state verification. Fuel addresses this by removing the need for a state tree and enabling computations to run in parallel, dramatically increasing efficiency. As a result, Fuel not only makes execution more efficient but also allows it to scale horizontally, making the system far more accessible to users without driving up costs or limiting throughput.

Cost-efficiency is a persistent problem as well. The cost per transaction on Ethereum often fluctuates, becoming inaccessibly high during times of congestion. This unpredictability harms both developers and users, limiting the types of applications that they can build at scale.

## The Scalability Dilemma

Many blockchain projects attempt to achieve scalability by simply increasing the hardware requirements for their nodes. This approach often makes it more expensive for users to participate, sidelining smaller users and compromising decentralization. However, true scalability requires more than just this incremental approach. It demands inherent improvements in the way transactions and blocks are processed without escalating the computational burden on the network.

For example, early blockchains like Ethereum rely on sequential processing, meaning transactions are executed one after another. This linear model is a severe limitation when it comes to modern processors, which are built with multi-core architectures designed for parallel processing.

Parallelism, or the ability to process multiple transactions simultaneously, is one of the most promising solutions for blockchain scalability. However, enabling parallel transaction execution requires careful management of state access. If two transactions try to access the same state (for instance, attempting to spend the same funds), they can’t be processed in parallel. This leads to complex mechanisms in many blockchains that either attempt to predict state conflicts or reprocess conflicting transactions.

Fuel addresses these issues by adopting the UTXO model instead of Ethereum’s account-based model. In this model, every transaction defines its own state in the form of unspent transaction outputs, eliminating the risk of conflicting state access. As a result, Fuel can safely parallelize transaction execution, dramatically increasing throughput without compromising security.

In addition, Fuel’s architecture includes new primitives like predicates, which are inherently stateless. This statelessness allows predicates to be trivially processed in parallel, enabling a high degree of concurrency in transaction execution. Predicates facilitate the execution of multiple operations within a single transaction while ensuring that conflicts with other transactions are avoided. Because they do not maintain any state information between executions, predicates can be efficiently scheduled and processed simultaneously, significantly enhancing throughput. This feature is unique to Fuel and is critical for creating the kind of performance gains necessary to support real-world decentralized applications at scale.

## State Growth and Sustainability

As blockchains grow, so does their state. State refers to all the data a blockchain needs to store and maintain, such as account balances, smart contract bytecode, and user interactions with dApps. The problem with state growth is that it tends to balloon out of control. Every new transaction adds more data, and this accumulation increases the burden on node operators. As the state becomes larger, nodes must store and manage increasingly extensive amounts of data, leading to higher hardware requirements and potentially threatening decentralization.

Ethereum, for example, is currently grappling with state bloat, which many core developers consider the network’s most pressing scaling issues. As the state grows, nodes must store increasingly large amounts of data, which increases hardware requirements and threatens decentralization. While various solutions, like statelessness and state expiry, are being explored in the Ethereum ecosystem, none have been fully implemented yet.

Fuel tackles the problem of state growth head-on by implementing strategies that minimize unnecessary data accumulation. By optimizing data storage and management practices, Fuel reduces the amount of state that needs to be maintained by nodes, alleviating the burden on operators. Additionally, Fuel’s architecture allows for more efficient data handling, ensuring that as transactions are processed, the overall state remains manageable and sustainable over the long term. This approach helps maintain decentralization and accessibility, enabling the network to support a growing number of users and applications without facing the pitfalls of excessive state growth.

## Interoperability and Fragmentation

Another major problem in today’s multi-chain world is interoperability. Ethereum’s success as a unified state machine is largely due to its ability to compose applications, access any asset, and allow seamless interaction between dApps. However, as Ethereum has grown congested, users have started migrating to other L1s and L2s, creating a fragmented ecosystem. Each new chain comes with its own set of challenges, including the need for separate wallets, token bridges, and onboarding processes.

Fuel is designed to reunite this fragmented ecosystem with a focus on interoperability at its core. Unlike most rollup projects, Fuel is not constrained by the EVM. Its flexible architecture allows for innovative design choices that enable seamless interactions across multiple chains while maintaining full Ethereum compatibility. Fuel’s transaction model and block design make cross-chain integrations easier to work with, simplifying the movement of assets and data between chains.

Additionally, Fuel’s proposed design for a shared sequencer is designed for speed and efficiency, enabling rapid processing of transactions across chains. This fast shared sequencing will allow developers to build versatile, cross-chain applications without the latency and fragmentation typically seen in multi-chain environments.

Fuel’s unique transaction and block architecture further enhances interoperability by providing execution evidence in the form of receipt roots and smart contract state roots. These verifiable proofs make it easier for other chains to interact with Fuel’s network, improving the overall user experience and enabling more fluid cross-chain functionality.

## The Future: A Modular, Decentralized World

The current blockchain landscape is riddled by performance limitations, low scalability and state sustainability, as well as lack of interoperability. These problems not only threaten the decentralized nature of blockchain but also limit the kinds of applications that can thrive within it. Fuel’s innovations—such as its UTXO-based parallelism, modular architecture, and cross-chain capabilities—are designed to overcome these limitations and set a new standard for blockchain infrastructure.
