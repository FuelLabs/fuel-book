# Beginnings

The blockchain landscape today is littered with a wide variety of fragmented solutions—Layer 1s, rollups, sequencers—all attempting to scale, decentralize, and power the future of the internet. We believe the current landscape of solutions is hamstrung by inefficiencies, unsustainable growth, and compromises in security.

In their race to market, many of these solutions opted to copy and paste existing architectures. Very few were willing to build from scratch, from the ground up. Why? It’s a massive undertaking that often seems like a bad business decision. Starting fresh requires immense resources, time, and technical expertise—along with a willingness to challenge the status quo. For most projects, this risk was too great, and so, they took the safer route, layering incremental improvements over the same old frameworks. This lack of original architectural vision leaves the ecosystem with solutions that are, at their core, stuck with the same limitations they set out to overcome.

Enter Fuel: a bold solution to these limitations.

Picture a group of early Ethereum developers, driven by a vision to enhance the performance, sustainability, interoperability, and developer experience of Ethereum. They recognized that to achieve this, a fresh architectural approach was necessary—one that would incorporate 17 years of blockchain evolution while adhering to the cypherpunk ideals of decentralization and accessibility.

The blockchain ecosystem has undergone a remarkable transformation since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009. Layer 1 blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, served as the foundational networks that introduced decentralized systems to the world. As demand for scalability surged, modular approaches emerged, allowing developers to customize and optimize their architectures. This led to the development of rollups—layer 2 solutions designed to aggregate transactions, significantly improving throughput while leveraging the security of their underlying L1 networks. Meanwhile, sequencers have surfaced as critical components in managing the order of transactions within these rollup frameworks, ensuring efficiency and reliability.

However, despite these advancements, the blockchain landscape still lacks a crucial piece of the puzzle: scalability without compromise. Most solutions sacrifice decentralization for performance, or security for speed, often resulting in trade-offs that undermine the core principles of blockchain technology.

For example, many L1 and L2 solutions increase node requirements to handle more transactions, improving throughput and reducing latency. However, this approach reduces the number of participants able to validate the chain and keep it secure.

Similarly, some rollups and sidechains achieve higher speeds by implementing trust assumptions that deviate from the foundational principles of security and decentralization. These solutions may rely on multi-signature schemes or other trust-based models to validate transactions, which introduce vulnerabilities. Users must place their trust in small groups of signers, which can be susceptible to hacking or coordination attacks.  

This critical need for a scalable, trustless, and performant system—one that doesn’t trade off on the core principles of blockchain—remains unmet.
This is why we built Fuel.

In December 2020, Fuel emerged as the first optimistic rollup on Ethereum, with the launch of Fuel V1. We sought to create a trust-minimized sidechain that would inherit the security of Ethereum while introducing a radically redesigned execution model based on UTXOs, or Unspent Transaction Outputs.

Despite the early days of Fuel V1 seeing limited adoption, it garnered significant attention within the blockchain community. Many regarded Fuel V1 as the one “pure” rollup, primarily due to its approach to security and execution. Unlike other architectures, Fuel V1 demonstrated true security inheritance without relying on third-party multi-signatures or sacrificing the integrity of optimistic fraud proofs.

Fuel V1’s design philosophy laid the groundwork for all Ethereum rollups and ultimately, our vision, leading to a more refined architecture in Fuel V2.

Over the past three and a half years, Fuel has evolved significantly, morphing into a new blockchain architecture that thoughtfully addresses the common challenges faced by modern blockchains. Our vision culminated in what we now call Fuel V2, an operating system for rollups—the "Rollup OS." This framework empowers developers to build and customize their own rollups while leveraging the security and robustness of underlying L1s like Ethereum for settlement and access to Ethereum’s vast liquidity and assets.

Imagine Fuel as a robust framework designed to foster the development of sustainable and high-performance rollups. By providing this architecture, we are committed to ensuring the community has the tools and pathways to support millions of innovative rollups.

The narrative of Fuel is interwoven with the histories of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin, with its concise yet revolutionary whitepaper, birthed a philosophical movement centered around self-sovereignty and trust in cryptography. In contrast, Ethereum expanded the horizon, introducing a programmable platform that unleashed a wave of creativity and innovation among developers.

Fuel acknowledges these contributions while seeking to fill the gaps left by conventional architectures. As we delve deeper into the intricacies of blockchain technology, we invite you to explore the problems we aim to solve and the vision we aspire to realize. Welcome to the beginnings of Fuel—a journey toward a sustainable, performant, and decentralized future.
